    "long": "DigitalOcean Droplets For WHMCS has been developed to automate the provisioning and further operations that you and your clients may perform on virtual machines. The module features a number of configurable options, allowing you to deliver servers easily manageable in key parameters without leaving your website. Having remote access to every single tool, your customers will quickly power their Droplets on and off, reboot each machine or shut it down completely. If in need of rebuilding a server, they can choose from the images of OS distributions, One-Click Install Apps, or even snapshots you have yourself shared. Additionally, clients will be able to apply inbound and outbound firewall rules to Droplets, as well as create their own snapshots and use automatic backups so as to restore the VM anytime later on. The module will also grant them password-less login to the virtual server after providing the SSH public key in the ordering process. Meanwhile, you will keep full control over the gamut of components available to your customers, and navigate each supervisory task straight in the admin area.",
